<p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based,
    multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language.
</p>
<p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production.
</p>
<p>It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games.
</p>
<p>The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means
    of a built-in JavaScript engine.
</p>
<p>Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript
    specification, with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features
    beyond ECMA.
